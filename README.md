All the teenagers and adults using social media

Why we build it?
Sometimes, when we accidentally post something really awkward by simlply clicking the "post" button
Also, sometimes our wording might be offensive or too negative to others and we do not realize~
This Chrome Extension Allows user to check your content to make sure your wording is wholesome and appropriate


Future Improvement and Possible Implementation
Due to the shortage of time, this chrome extension only apply to Facebook, but actually we can adopt it to Twitter, Instagram, Youtube
